Solandium 2063 is an experimental 3D solarpunk strategy computer game with integrated artificial intelligence, developed by multimedia artist Nejc Trampu≈æ and his team. Set in the dystopian future of 2063, your mission is to strategise through dialogue with the AI to transform an abandoned robotic centre into an eco-community - will you succeed in creating a sustainable society? <br><br>
This hybrid between artwork, computer game and interactive education tool is also a technological experiment, as the game elements have been generated using the latest AI tools. It follows the aesthetics and values of solarpunk, optimistically striving for a just and ecological society and the responsible use of technology. Solandium 2063 explores the role of AI in the transition towards sustainability, highlighting its potential in addressing environmental challenges and drawing attention to the downsides such as high energy consumption and biases. <br><br>
At the heart of the project is the belief that every individual has the power and responsibility to contribute to a better future and invites people to actively co-shape the world.
